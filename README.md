# REDUX Counter with PureJS

This is a repository for [this bonus exercise](https://github.com/gabrieldeori/trybe-exercises/tree/main/016.REDUX_State_Management), consider the bonus exercise for day 1.

### Bonus

Now you are going to increment the code that was made during the live class.

1. Make a field that receives a value and that will be the value applied to the increment button.
2. Make a field that receives a value and that will be the value applied to the decrement button.
3. Store another value in the state, called clickCount. This field will count the number of times that any button on the screen was clicked.
4. Store an array in the state that stores the individual value that was added to each click on any of the three buttons.
